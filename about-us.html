				My journey started from my time in the gym. I was always looking for Gym clothing that could allow me to workout freely without uncomfortablility, and that was truly amazing for workout with the high intensity workouts that would make you sweat. 
				<br>
				However it was always difficult to find a store that could provide gym clothing that could meet all of my needs and still looked good while i worked out and majority of stores or brands would cater to womens gym clothing more than mens.
				<br>
				With a problem at hand, an idea in mind and workout buddies to support me, i decided to make my own gym clothing company that could answer every mens question, "Where can i find gym clothing for me?"
				<br>
				Thats when Lyceum was created and founded. 
				<br>
				Through the mission of answering every mans question
				<br>
				And providing every gym clothing essential they would need.
